    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Outside skirt steak, also known as Entraña, is a unique cut of beef you may have enjoyed at Argentinian steakhouses or restaurants. You would remember it because of its show stopping appearance – thin and very long, often times well over two feet. It is known for its filet like tenderness, rich ribeye like marbling and decadent beefy flavor. </p>
